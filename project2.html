MY SCHOOL    
 </h2> 
 <p>My school is a wonderful place where I learn new things every day. In this my school paragraph, I want to share how much
I love going to school. When I write a paragraph on my school, I always mention the big, colorful library. Our my school
library paragraph would tell you about the amazing books it has. I love reading stories and learning about the world
there.

Short paragraph on my school: It’s a friendly and happy place with lots of fun activities. We even had a mock drill in
my school paragraph where we learned how to be safe during emergencies. This paragraph about school wouldn’t be complete
without mentioning my kind teachers and the fun playground. In my school paragraph in English, I would say that it’s a
place where I make great memories and friends. I always look forward to going to my school because every day is an
adventure.
