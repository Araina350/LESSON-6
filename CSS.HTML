 <h1>THE AWESOME EASTERN GHATS</h1>  
 <h2> Let's explore about eastern ghats</h2>  
<p style="color:white;background-color:black;">The Eastern Ghats run from northern Odisha through Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu in the south passing some parts of
Karnataka. They are eroded and cut through by the four major rivers of peninsular India, known as the Godavari,
Mahanadi, Krishna, and Kaveri</p>
