 <p>The Milky Way galaxy is home to many stars, planets and planetary systems. One such planetary system is our Solar
System. Our Solar System has eight planets, of which Earth is the fourth. The Earth rotates on its axis, which causes
days and nights. It also revolves around the Sun in a fixed orbit, which causes the change in seasons.</p>

<p>The strategic position and movement of the Earth support the millions of species of plants and animals that inhabit it.
The right elements and external forces allowed the formation of land and water bodies which provide homes and nutrients
to the millions of species on the planet.</p>

<p>We humans have been overusing our resources as well as polluting the environment, which
is negatively affecting the planet and our co-habitants. We must strive to save the planet now before it is too late.
